## Where to find Arkadia Moon Deeds?

You can find Arkadia Moon Deeds in the auction in Entropia Universe. We will search for *"Arkadia Moon"* in the *Estate Deeds* Category on Planet Calypso. You can actually find them in any planet but Planet Calypso is known for being the hub for selling items because it is the oldest, and it has the most foot traffic. You can also recognize the name Arkadia which is from the Planet Arkadia and more specifically its moon. Deeds mean that the planet partner is sharing the profit from player activity to everyone owns deeds. The minimum payout is 0.01PED per deed every few days guarantee.
