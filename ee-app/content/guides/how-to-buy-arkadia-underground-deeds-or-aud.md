## Where to find Arkadia Underground Deeds?

You can find Arkadia Underground Deeds in the auction in Entropia Universe. We will search for *"Arkadia Underground"* in the *Estate Deeds* Category on Planet Calypso. You can actually find them in any planet but Planet Calypso is known for being the hub for selling items because it is the oldest, and it has the most foot traffic. You can also recognize the name Arkadia which is from the Planet Arkadia. Deeds mean that the planet partner is sharing the profit from player activity to everyone owns deeds. The minimum payout is 0.01PED per deed every day guarantee.
