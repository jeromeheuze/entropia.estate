## Where to find estates deeds?

Now that you purchased your *Estate Deed* - You are ready to claim your property. It is important to do so. If you do not claim the property you might be able to get inside and place your own furniture and invite your friends. Also, some sellers do not open their properties to the public - but it is rare.

## Get to the nearest teleporter

Usually when looking at the list of teleporters available to you - you can guess where to go - For this property we need to go to **Omegaton West Habitat**. If for some reason you do not have that name select the nearest and fly, drive, or walk there. Entropia Universe is an exploration game first with very big maps and plenty of enemies to find.
