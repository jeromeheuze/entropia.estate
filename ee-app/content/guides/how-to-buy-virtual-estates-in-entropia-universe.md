You can find estates deeds on the auction from each planet partners, it can be bought from players, redeemed from NPC (Mirsal tokens from Planet Toulan or Arkadia tokens in the past), and from players shops. Since there is no way too osearch players' shops - you will need to explore a little. I did find some in FOMA shops and Twin Peaks shops. You can always do posting in [Planet Calypso Forum](https://www.planetcalypsoforum.com) - *WTB estates deed* - and see if anyone wants to sell their properties.

You can find the more descriptive text as well - though it is not very important for deed estate items.

## Show on map the estate

You can *right-click* on the deed to show you where the estate is located - just look for the "H" on the map.

## Create a waypoint to visit estate

Open you map to see the waypoint - you might even see a floating cursor that you keep seeing until you reach the destination - it is good when you're flying around the planet.

## Bid price vs buyout price

Here something to remember when buying deeds - TT (Trade Terminal) value is 0.01PED - so you see a pricing of (TT+1498.99 PED) for the opening bid. So since the amount of the auction are we can just bid the estate right now for 1499.00PED and wait for auction to expire or when someone else bid.

</div>

But we just buy the estate now so the price of the buyout is 1550.00PED - which is an acceptable price for this type of estate. It is in a nice area. Of course before we should have gone to estate first to look at the view.

First let me give some insight on the naming convention of deeds in Calypso Omegaton area.

- **Omegaton Complex** is the name of the area or complex - which means we know it is player housing and not a shop.
- **Gamma** is the name of the tower to look for on the map when you go to Omegaton West Habitat.
- **13** is the floor number - you better look up and should have a great view.
- **F** is apartment number and also the name of the layout used for that estate.

Since the opening bid and buyout bid are different we need tro increase our offer - a little trick is to click on the far left top arrow to match the buyout price. 

## Purchase estate

Just click *Place Bid* and to purchase the estate.

Click *OK* and open our inventory to verify the actual deed in our possession.
